As it orbits, Venus comes closer to Earth than any other planet in the solar system and can come to within about 40 million km.", "The third closest planet to the Sun is Earth and is the largest and densest of the inner planets. Earth orbits in a reasonably circular at 150 million km and is the first of the planets to have a moon. Earth is of course the only place that we know of that has life.", "Mars is the fourth closest planet to the Sun and orbits in an fairly eccentric orbit at around 230 (+-20) million km.", "Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to the Sun and is the first of what are called the outer planets (being outside the asteroid belt). It is by far the largest planet in the solar system having two and a half times as much mass as all the other planets put together and one thousandth the mass of the Sun.", "Saturn is the sixth closest planet to the Sun. It is the second largest planet in the solar system having a radius 9 times that of Earth (57,000 km) and a mass 95 times that of Earth.", "Uranus is the seventh closest planet to the Sun and the third largest and fourth heaviest of the planets. It diameter (50,000km) is four times that of Earth with a mass over 14 times that of Earth.", "Neptune is the eighth closest planet to the Sun and is (since the relegation of Pluto) the last Planet in the Solar System. It is similar in size and composition to Uranus with a diameter of 49,000km and a mass of over 17 times that of Earth."]
